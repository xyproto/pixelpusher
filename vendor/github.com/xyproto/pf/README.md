# PixelFunctions

Apply functions to each pixel in an image, concurrently.

This module contains functions that fit well together with the [pixelpusher](https://github.com/xyproto/pixelpusher) module.

The `PixelFunction` type has this signature:

    func(v uint32) uint32

If you have a pixel buffer of type `[]uint32`, with colors on the form `ARGB`, then this modules allows you to apply functions of the type `PixelFunction` to that slice, concurrently.

The goal is to avoid looping over all pixels more than once, while applying many different effects, concurrently.

## Combine and Map

* Several `PixelFunction` functions can be combined to a single `PixelFunction` by using the `Combine` function.
* A `PixelFuncion` can be applied to a pixel buffer by using the `Map` function.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/xyproto/pf"
    "runtime"
)

func main() {
    // Resolution
    const w, h = 320, 200

    pixels := make([]uint32, w*h)

    // Find the number of available CPUs
    n := runtime.NumCPU()

    // Combine two pixel functions
    pfs := pf.Combine(pf.InvertEverything, pf.OnlyBlue)

    // Run the combined pixel functions over all pixels using all available CPUs
    pf.Map(n, pfs, pixels)

    // Retrieve the red, green and blue components of the first pixel
    red := (pixels[0] | 0x00ff0000) >> 0xffff
    green := (pixels[0] | 0x0000ff00) >> 0xff
    blue := (pixels[0] | 0x000000ff)

    // Should output only blue: rgb(0, 0, 255)
    fmt.Printf("rgb(%d, %d, %d)\n", red, green, blue)
}
```
